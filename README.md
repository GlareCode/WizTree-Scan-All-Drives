# Scan all drives with WizTree and Powershell

This script helps wiztree scan for multiple drives automatically and append the csv's.
I made this because WizTree doesn't seem to scan for multiple drives in a single command line. Hopefully others will find this usefull.

Copy the .ps1 contents into your powershell cli or make a .ps1 and paste and check your \tmp for scans(date).csv file.
